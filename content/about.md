I'm software engineer with 10+ years of professional experience. During my career, I have been developing a lot of
things from big and complicated systems to small few liners to make life easier. I do care about creating good quality
software that delivers value to people using it. Close cooperation with stakeholders is a must to create great things
together. In the pursuit to find the perfect code, I’m constantly improving my skills by learning new technologies,
frameworks and architectural approaches. I understand that software that’s produced is a tool which is meant to solve
business problems.
