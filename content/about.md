### About me

I'm software engineer with 10+ years of professional experience. During my career, I’ve worked with many technologies,
languages, frameworks, and database engines. My primary area of expertise is around JVM. I like to learn new things even
if I’m not going to use them for work. I’ve worked in companies with various organizational styles. I have experience
with legacy monolithic systems, microservice-oriented ones, and mostly with those somewhere in between. I also filled a
couple of other software-related roles. I developed and maintained automated tests. I implemented integration and
deployment pipelines. I have experience working very closely with business and project owners. I managed the development
team. I was responsible for planning big projects. I’m not afraid of production issues and don’t freeze on unexpected
production failure. I like to work with end-users of the system to better understand how they use it. In short, I like
to wear multiple hats when working on a project.

I like to work in agile methodologies where each team member has an impact on how the software works, can propose
solutions to the problems at hand and features to be developed in the feature. I believe this approach makes people
engaged and responsible for the work they do. I like the pragmatic approach to solving problems and working with the
software.
